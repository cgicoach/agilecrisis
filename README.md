Collaboration space to bring TAC presentation online.
This file is a generic TODO list we can use to track initial progress.
The rest we could do in issues in Github. Repo is public, I think there is no need to
hide something that will become a public presentation anyway.

##TODO
---
* Organize into Myths
* Create branches per Myth
* Create Story boards for Myths
* Split Story Boards into hard science/soft science.
* Create list of assets needed (video, supporting pictures etc)
* Populate repository of supporting hard science data for story board statements.
